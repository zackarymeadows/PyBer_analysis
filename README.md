# PyBer Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to analyze fares in different types of city using data provided by ride share companies. 

## Results
When taking a look at the summary data, it is clear that the farther away from the city, the more expensive the fares are. This correlates with the average fare per driver.

###
Urban drivers took exponentially more fares, but their average price per fare was over 50% less than that of a rural driver.

## Summary

To combat the disparities among city types, perhaps a surge fee could be implemented. This fee could be scaled to increase as the area becomes more urban.
##
It would be helpful to have the data for the distance of each trip. This could explain the discrepancy between urban and rural areas.  I belive that the fares in rural areas would be larger because of the increased distance between destinations. 
Addionally, it would be beneficial to have the price model for these fares. How much is charged per mile, per trip, ect.
